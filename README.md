The ft_printf project aims to create a custom library that includes the ft_printf() function, mimicking the behavior of the standard printf() function. The ft_printf() function, with the prototype int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);, handles various conversions such as %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %%.
